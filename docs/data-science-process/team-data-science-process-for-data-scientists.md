# Team Data Science Process for data scientists

This article provides guidance for objectives that you set when you implement comprehensive data science solutions with Azure technologies. You're guided through:

- Understanding an analytics workload.
- Using the Team Data Science Process.
- Using Azure Machine Learning.
- Understanding the foundations of data transfer and storage.
- Providing data source documentation.
- Using tools for analytics processing.

These training materials are related to the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) and Microsoft open-source software and toolkits, which are helpful for envisioning, executing, and delivering data science solutions.
