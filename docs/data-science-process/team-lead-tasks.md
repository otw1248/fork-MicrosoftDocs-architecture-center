# Team lead tasks in the Team Data Science Process

This article describes the tasks that a *team lead* completes for a data science team. The team lead's objective is to establish a collaborative team environment that standardizes on the [Team Data Science Process](overview.yml) (TDSP). The TDSP is designed to help improve collaboration and team learning.

The TDSP is an agile, iterative data science methodology to efficiently deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications. The process incorporates the best practices and structures from Microsoft and the data science industry. The goal of the TDSP is successful implementation of data science initiatives and fully realizing the benefits of analytics programs. For an outline of the personnel roles and associated tasks, see [Team Data Science Process roles and tasks](roles-tasks.md).

A team lead manages a team that consists of several data scientists in the data science unit of an enterprise. Depending on the data science unit's size and structure, the [group manager](group-manager-tasks.md) and the team lead might be the same person. The team lead can delegate their tasks to surrogates, but the tasks for the role don't change.

## Major roles of the team lead

-  **Project coordination and management**:
    -   Oversee the day-to-day management of data science projects, ensuring they are on track and aligned with the project goals.
    -   Coordinate tasks among team members and ensure efficient workflow.

-  **Technical leadership**:
    -   Provide technical guidance and expertise to the team.
    -   Make key decisions on technical approaches, tools, and methodologies.
-  **Team collaboration and communication**:
    -   Foster a collaborative environment and ensure effective communication within the team.
    -   Act as the main point of contact for the project, facilitating communication between team members and other stakeholders.
-  **Resource allocation**:
    -   Ensure the right allocation of resources (personnel, technology, data) for the project.
    -   Identify and address resource gaps.
-  **Quality assurance**:
    -   Uphold high standards of quality in project deliverables.
    -   Implement quality control measures and ensure adherence to best practices.
-  **Mentorship and team development**:
    -   Mentor team members, helping them grow their skills and capabilities.
    -   Encourage continuous learning and professional development within the team.
-  **Stakeholder engagement**:
    -   Engage with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
    -   Communicate progress, challenges, and results effectively to stakeholders.
-  **Risk management**:
    -   Identify and mitigate project risks.
    -   Develop contingency plans to address potential challenges.

## Key tasks for the team lead

-   **Plan and track projects**:
    -   Develop detailed project plans, including timelines, milestones, and deliverables.
    -   Track project progress and make adjustments as needed.
-   **Solve technical problems**:
    -   Lead the team in solving complex technical problems.
    -   Ensure the application of appropriate data science methodologies and techniques.
-   **Perform team meetings and reviews**:
    -   Conduct regular team meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps.
    -   Lead project review sessions to assess the quality and impact of the work.
-   **Monitor performance**:
    -   Monitor the performance of individual team members.
    -   Provide feedback and guidance to improve performance and efficiency.
-   **Document and report**:
    -   Ensure comprehensive documentation of the project's progress and outcomes.
    -   Prepare reports and presentations for stakeholders.
-   **Comply with standards**:
    -   Ensure compliance with data governance, privacy, and ethical standards.
    -   Adhere to organizational and industry best practices.

## Use language models and copilots

In the TDSP, the team lead plays a crucial role in guiding the project team and ensuring the successful execution of data science projects. Language models and copilots can significantly contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the data science team's operations. The team lead can integrate language models and copilots to align with the TDSP framework in the following areas:

- **Manage and coordinate models**

  -   *Project planning assistance*: Use language models to aid in developing comprehensive project plans, including timelines, resource allocation, and risk assessment.
  -   *Task assignment and progress tracking*: Use copilots for efficient task management and progress tracking, ensuring that team members are on track with their responsibilities.

- **Provide technical leadership and guidance**

  -   *Technical research and insights*: Use language models to stay abreast of the latest data science techniques, tools, and best practices relevant to the project.
  -   *Algorithm and tool selection*: Use the knowledge base of language models for recommendations on the best algorithms, tools, and technologies to use in specific project contexts.

- **Improve team collaboration and communication**

  -   *Effective communication*: Employ language models to draft and refine communication with team members and other stakeholders, ensuring clarity and effectiveness.
  -   *Collaboration enhancement*: Use copilots to streamline collaborative efforts, schedule meetings, and manage team discussions and brainstorming sessions.

- **Provide quality assurance and reviews**

  -   *Code review and quality checks*: Use language models for automated code reviews, ensuring adherence to best practices and identifying potential issues.
  -   *Documentation review*: Use language models to help review and enhance project documentation, ensuring comprehensiveness and clarity.

- **Train and mentor**

  -   *Skill development resources*: Use language models to generate or curate training materials and resources for the team, addressing skill gaps and promoting continuous learning.
  -   *Mentoring guidance*: Employ language models for insights on effective mentoring techniques and personalized development plans for team members.

- **Manage risks and problem solve**

  -   *Risk identification and mitigation*: Use language models for identifying potential project risks and generating strategies for mitigation.
  -   *Problem-solving assistance*: Use copilots and language models for brainstorming and developing solutions to technical and project-related challenges.

- **Engage stakeholders**

  -   *Stakeholder reporting*: Use language models to create comprehensive and understandable reports for stakeholders, detailing project progress, challenges, and achievements.
  -   *Meeting preparation*: Employ language models for preparing agendas, presentations, and key talking points for stakeholder meetings.

- **Continuously Improve**

  -   *Feedback analysis*: Use language models to analyze feedback from team members and stakeholders, identifying areas for improvement and action points.
  -   *Process optimization*: Use copilots to continuously refine and optimize project workflows and team processes.

## Summary

In the TDSP, the team lead plays a critical role in project management, technical guidance, team collaboration, quality assurance, and stakeholder engagement. They're responsible for steering the project effectively, ensuring the team works cohesively and maintains high standards of data science work.
