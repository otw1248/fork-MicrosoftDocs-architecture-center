### Dataflow

1. Log in to an on-premises head node.
1. Add Azure compute nodes to the cluster.
1. Start the compute nodes.
1. Submit jobs to the cluster.
1. HPC Pack sends jobs to on-premises and Azure nodes, based upon the node group selected.
1. Monitor the job progress.
1. Stop the compute nodes or configure autoscaling.

### Components

* [Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines): Create Linux and Windows virtual machines in seconds.
* [Microsoft HPC Pack](/powershell/high-performance-computing/overview) : Free HPC solution built on Microsoft Azure and Windows Server technologies.

## Scenario details

Microsoft HPC Pack is a free HPC solution built on Microsoft Azure and Windows Server technologies. HPC Pack combines a comprehensive set of deployment, administration, job scheduling, and monitoring tools for your Windows and Linux HPC cluster environment, providing a flexible platform for developing and running HPC applications on premises and in Azure.

### Potential use cases

This solution shows the process for using HPC Pack to create a hybrid (on-premises and Azure) HPC environment.
