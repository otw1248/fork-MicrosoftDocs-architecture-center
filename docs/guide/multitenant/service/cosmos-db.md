# Multitenancy and Azure Cosmos DB

On this page, we describe some of the features of Azure Cosmos DB that are useful when you're working with multitenant systems. We also link to guidance and examples for how to use Azure Cosmos DB in a multitenant solution.

## Features of Azure Cosmos DB that support multitenancy

### Partitioning

By using partitions with your Azure Cosmos DB containers, you can create containers that are shared across multiple tenants. Typically you use the tenant identifier as a partition key, but you might also consider using multiple partition keys for a single tenant. A well-planned partitioning strategy effectively implements the [Sharding pattern](../../../patterns/sharding.yml). With large containers, Azure Cosmos DB spreads your tenants across multiple physical nodes to achieve a high degree of scale.

We recommend that you explore the use of [hierarchical partition keys](/azure/cosmos-db/hierarchical-partition-keys) to improve the performance of your multitenant solution. Hierarchical partition keys enable you to create a partition key that includes multiple values. For example, you might use a hierarchical partition key that includes the tenant identifier and the type of data that you're storing. This approach allows you to scale beyond the logical partition limit of 20 GB per partition key value.

### Managing request units

Azure Cosmos DB pricing model is based on the number of *request units* per second that you provision or consume. A request unit is a logical abstraction of the cost of a database operation or query. Typically, you provision a defined number of request units per second for your workload, which is referred to as *throughput*. Azure Cosmos DB provides several options for how you provision throughput. In a multitenant environment, the selection you make affects the performance and price of your Azure Cosmos DB resources.

One tenancy model for Azure Cosmos DB involves deploying separate containers for each tenant within a shared database. Azure Cosmos DB enables you to provision request units for a database, and all of the containers share the request units. If your tenant workloads don't typically overlap, this approach can help reduce your operational costs. However, this approach is susceptible to the [Noisy Neighbor problem](../../../antipatterns/noisy-neighbor/noisy-neighbor.yml) because a single tenant's container might consume a disproportionate amount of the shared provisioned request units. To mitigate this issue, first identify the noisy tenants. Then, you can optionally set provisioned throughput on a specific container. The other containers in the database continue to share their throughput, but the noisy tenant consumes their own dedicated throughput.

Azure Cosmos DB also provides a serverless tier, which is suited for workloads with intermittent or unpredictable traffic. Alternatively, autoscaling enables you to configure policies to specify the scaling of provisioned throughput. Additionally, you can take advantage of Azure Cosmos DB burst capacity, maximizing the utilization of your provisioned throughput capacity, which would have been rate limited otherwise. In a multitenant solution, you might combine all of these approaches to support different types of tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> When planning your Azure Cosmos DB configuration, ensure you consider the [service quotas and limits](/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits).

To monitor and manage the costs that are associated with each tenant, every operation using the Azure Cosmos DB API includes the request units consumed. You can use this information to aggregate and compare the actual request units consumed by each tenant, and you can then identify tenants with different performance characteristics.

### Customer-managed keys

Some tenants might require the use of their own encryption keys. Azure Cosmos DB provides a customer-managed key feature. This feature is applied at the level of an Azure Cosmos DB account, so tenants who require their own encryption keys need to be deployed using dedicated Azure Cosmos DB accounts.

## Isolation models

When working with a multitenant system that uses Azure Cosmos DB, you need to make a decision about the level of isolation you want to use. Business-to-business (B2B) refers to selling to a business. Business-to-consumer (B2C) refers to selling directly to an individual customer who uses the product or service. Azure Cosmos DB supports several isolation models:

| Workload need | Partition key per tenant | Container per tenant (shared throughput) | Container per tenant (dedicated throughput) | Database per tenant | Database account per tenant |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Queries across tenants | Easy (container acts as boundary for   queries) | Hard | Hard | Hard | Hard |
| Tenant density | High (lowest cost per tenant) | Medium | Low | Low | Low |
| Tenant data deletion | Hard | Easy (drop container when tenant leaves) | Easy (drop container when tenant leaves) | Easy (drop database when tenant leaves) | Easy (drop database when tenant leaves) |
| Data access security isolation | Needs to be implemented within the   application | Container RBAC | Container RBAC | Database RBAC | RBAC |
| Geo-replication | Per tenant geo-replication not possible | Group tenants within database accounts   based on requirements | Group tenants within database accounts   based on requirements | Group tenants within database accounts   based on requirements | Group tenants within database accounts   based on requirements |
| Noisy neighbor prevention | None | None | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| New tenant creation latency | Immediate | Fast | Fast | Medium | Slow |
| Data modeling advantages | None | entity colocation | entity colocation | Multiple containers to model tenant   entities | Multiple containers and databases to   model tenants |
| Encryption key | Same for all tenants | Same for all tenants | Same for all tenants | Same for all tenants | Customer managed key per tenant |
| Throughput requirements | >0 RUs per tenant | >100 RUs per tenant | >100 RUs per tenant (with autoscale only, otherwise >400 RUs per tenant) | >400 RUs per tenant | >400 RUs per tenant |
| Example use case(s) | B2C apps | Standard offer for B2B apps | Premium offer for B2B apps | Premium offer for B2B apps | Premium offer for B2B apps |

### Partition key per tenant

When you use a single container for multiple tenants, you can make use of Azure Cosmos DB partitioning support. By using separate partition keys for each tenant, you can easily query the data for a single tenant. You can also query across multiple tenants, even if they are in separate partitions. However, [cross-partition queries](/azure/cosmos-db/sql/how-to-query-container#cross-partition-query) have a higher request unit (RU) cost than single-partition queries.

This approach tends to work well when the amount of data stored for each tenant is small. It can be a good choice for building a [pricing model](../considerations/pricing-models.md) that includes a free tier, and for business-to-consumer (B2C) solutions. In general, by using shared containers, you achieve the highest density of tenants and therefore the lowest price per tenant.

It's important to consider the throughput of your container. All of the tenants will share the container's throughput, so the [Noisy Neighbor problem](../../../antipatterns/noisy-neighbor/noisy-neighbor.yml) can cause performance challenges if your tenants have high or overlapping workloads. This problem can sometimes be mitigated by grouping subsets of tenants into different containers, and by ensuring that each tenant group has compatible usage patterns. Alternatively, you can consider a hybrid multi- and single-tenant model. Group smaller tenants into shared partitioned containers, and give large customers dedicated containers. Also, there are features that can help control the noisy neighbor problem when modeling tenant by partition, such as [throughput reallocation](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/distribute-throughput-across-partitions), [burst capacity](/azure/cosmos-db/burst-capacity), and [throughput control](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/throughput-control-spark) in the [Java SDK](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/sdk-java-v4).

It's also important to consider the amount of data you store in each logical partition. Azure Cosmos DB allows each logical partition to grow to up to 20 GB. If you have a single tenant that needs to store more than 20 GB of data, consider spreading the data across multiple logical partitions. For example, instead of having a single partition key of `Contoso`, you might *salt* the partition keys by creating multiple partition keys for a tenant, such as `Contoso1`, `Contoso2`, and so forth. When you query the data for a tenant, you can use the `WHERE IN` clause to match all of the partition keys. [Hierarchical partition keys](/azure/cosmos-db/hierarchical-partition-keys) can also be used to support large tenants, with storage greater than 20 GB, without having to use synthetic partition keys or multiple partition key values per tenant.

Consider the operational aspects of your solution, and the different phases of the [tenant lifecycle](../considerations/tenant-lifecycle.md). For example, when a tenant moves to a dedicated pricing tier, you'll likely need to move the data to a different container. When a tenant is deprovisioned, you need to run a delete query on the container to remove the data, and for large tenants, this query might consume a significant amount of throughput while it executes.

### Container per tenant

You can provision dedicated containers for each tenant. Dedicated containers work well when the data that you store for your tenant can be combined into a single container. This model provides greater performance isolation than the partition-key-per-tenant model above, and it also provides increased data access security isolation via [Azure RBAC](/azure/cosmos-db/role-based-access-control). 

When using a container for each tenant, you can consider sharing throughput with other tenants by provisioning throughput at the database level. Consider the restrictions and limits around the [minimum number of request units for your database](/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits#minimum-throughput-limits) and the [maximum number of containers in the database](/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits#provisioned-throughput-1). Also, consider whether your tenants require a guaranteed level of performance, and whether they're susceptible to the [Noisy Neighbor problem](../../../antipatterns/noisy-neighbor/noisy-neighbor.yml). When you share throughput at the database level, the workload or storage across all the containers should be relatively uniform. Otherwise you might have a noisy neighbor issue, if there are one or more large tenants. If necessary, plan to group these tenants into different databases that are based on workload patterns.

Alternatively, you can provision dedicated throughput for each container. This approach works well for larger tenants and for tenants that are at risk of the [Noisy Neighbor problem](../../../antipatterns/noisy-neighbor/noisy-neighbor.yml). However, the baseline throughput for each tenant is higher, so consider the minimum requirements and cost implications of this model.

If your tenant data model requires more than one entity, as long as all entities can share the same partition key, they can be colocated in the same container. However, if the tenant data model is more complex, and it requires entities that can't share the same partition key, consider the database-per-tenant or database-account-per-tenant models below. Take a look at our article on [how to model and partition data on Azure Cosmos DB using a real-world example](/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/how-to-model-partition-example) for more guidance.

Lifecycle management is generally simpler when containers are dedicated to tenants. You can [easily move tenants between shared and dedicated throughput models](/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput#set-throughput-on-a-database-and-a-container), and when deprovisioning a tenant, you can quickly delete the container.

### Database per tenant

You can provision databases for each tenant, in the same database account. Like the container-per-tenant model above, this model provides greater performance isolation than the partition-key-per-tenant model, and it also provides increased data access security isolation via [Azure RBAC](/azure/cosmos-db/role-based-access-control). 

Like the account-per-tenant model below, this approach gives the highest level of performance isolation, but it provides the lowest tenant density. However, this option is best when each tenant requires a more complicated data model than is feasible in the container-per-tenant model. Or, you should follow this approach when it's a requirement for new tenant creation to be fast and/or free of any overhead to create tenant accounts up-front. It may also be the case, for the specific software development framework being used, that database-per-tenant is the only level of performance isolation that's recognized in that framework. Entity (container) level isolation and entity colocation aren't typically supported natively in such frameworks.

### Database account per tenant

Azure Cosmos DB enables you to provision separate database accounts for each tenant, which provides the highest level of isolation, but the lowest density. Like the container-per-tenant and database-per-tenant models above, this model provides greater performance isolation than the partition-key-per-tenant key model. It also provides increased data access security isolation via [Azure RBAC](/azure/cosmos-db/role-based-access-control). In addition, this model provides database encryption security isolation at the tenant level via [customer managed keys](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-customer-managed-keys). 

A single database account is dedicated to a tenant, which means they aren't subject to the noisy neighbor problem. You can configure the location of the database account according to the tenant's requirements. You can also tune the configuration of Azure Cosmos DB features, such as geo-replication and customer-managed encryption keys, to suit each tenant's requirements. When using a dedicated Azure Cosmos DB account per tenant, consider the [maximum number of Azure Cosmos DB accounts per Azure subscription](/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits#control-plane-operations). 

If you use this model, you should consider how fast your application needs to be able to generate new tenants. Account creation in Azure Cosmos DB can take a few minutes, so you might need to create accounts up-front. If this approach isn't feasible, consider the database-per-tenant model.

If you allow tenants to migrate from a shared account to a dedicated Azure Cosmos DB account, consider the migration approach you'll use to move a tenant's data between the old and new accounts.

### Hybrid approaches

You can consider a combination of the above approaches to suit different tenants' requirements and [your pricing model](../considerations/pricing-models.md). For example:

- Provision all free trial customers within a shared container, and use the tenant ID or a [synthetic key partition key](/azure/cosmos-db/sql/synthetic-partition-keys).
- Offer a paid *Bronze* tier that deploys a dedicated container per tenant, but with [shared throughput on a database](/azure/cosmos-db/set-throughput#set-throughput-on-a-database).
- Offer a higher *Silver* tier that provisions dedicated throughput for the tenant's container.
- Offer the highest *Gold* tier, and provide a dedicated database account for the tenant, which also allows tenants to select the geography for their deployment.
