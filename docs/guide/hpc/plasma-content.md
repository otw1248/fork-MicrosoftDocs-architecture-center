This article briefly describes the steps for running [Samadii Plasma](https://www.metariver.kr/smdplasma.html) on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running Samadii Plasma on Azure.

Samadii Plasma provides high-performance plasma physics simulation. It simulates plasma physics by using a method that's based on ion and electron particles. Samadii Plasma's high-speed electromagnetic field analysis capabilities and particle-based gas analysis, based on GPU technology, enable highly advanced plasma simulation.

Organizations that use Samadii Plasma include manufacturers of flat panel and OLED displays and manufacturers of semiconductors. This solution is ideal for the manufacturing and electronics industries.

## Why deploy Samadii Plasma on Azure?

- Modern and diverse compute options to meet your workload's needs
- The flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware
- Rapid provisioning
- Strong performance scale-up, and configurations that provide either optimized scaling or optimized cost efficiency

### Components

- [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) is
    used to create a Windows VM. For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Windows VMs on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm.yml).
- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) is
    used to create a private network infrastructure in the cloud.
  - [Network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) restrict access to the VM.  
  - A public IP address connects the internet to the VM.
- A physical solid-state drive (SSD) provides storage.

## Compute sizing and drivers

The performance tests of Samadii Plasma on Azure used [NVv3](/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series), [NCasT4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series), and [NC_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nc-a100-v4-series) series VMs running Windows 10. The following table provides details about the VMs.

|VM size|GPU|Number of vCPUs|Memory, in GiB|Maximum data disks|Number of GPUs|GPU memory, in GiB|Maximum uncached disk throughput, in IOPS / MBps|Temporary storage (SSD), in GiB|Maximum NICs|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

### Required drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of [NVv3](/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series), [NCasT4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series), and [NC_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nc-a100-v4-series) series VMs, you need to install NVIDIA GPU drivers.

To use AMD processors on [NVv3](/azure/virtual-machines/nvv3-series), [NCasT4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series), [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), [ND_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series), and [NC_A100_v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nc-a100-v4-series) series VMs, you need to install AMD drivers.

## Samadii Plasma installation

Before you install Samadii Plasma, you need to deploy and connect a VM and install the required NVIDIA and AMD drivers.

For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see [Run a Windows VM on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm.yml). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NVIDIA Fabric Manager installation is required for VMs that use NVLink. ND_A100_v4 and NC_A100_v4 VMs use this technology.

Following are some prerequisites for running Samadii applications.
- Windows 10 (x64) OS
- One or more NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPUs: Tesla, Quadro, or GeForce series
- Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package 
- Microsoft MPI v7.1
- .NET Framework 4.5

The product installation process involves installing a license server, installing Samadii Plasma, and configuring the license server. For more information about installing Plasma, contact [Metariver Technology](https://www.metariver.kr/index.html).

## Azure cost

The following tables present simulation runtimes in hours. To compute the total cost, multiply these times by the Azure VM hourly costs for NVv3, NCasT4_v3, NCv3, ND_A100_v4, and NC_A100_v4 series VMs. For the current hourly costs, see [Windows Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/#pricing).

Only simulation runtime is considered in these cost calculations. Application installation time and license costs aren't included.

You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate the costs for your configuration.

## Summary

- Samadii Plasma was tested on Azure ND_A100_v4, NCv3, NCasT4_v3, NVv3, and NC_A100_v4 series VMs.
- For complex models, like magnetron sputter and import inlet, the Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4 VM provides the best performance.
- For models with less complexity, the NCasT4_v3 VM provides good scale-up, and the performance-to-cost ratio is better than that of the other VMs tested.
