This article briefly describes the steps for running [Altair
EDEM](https://www.altair.com/edem) on a virtual machine (VM) that's
deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running
EDEM on Azure.

EDEM is an application that's used for bulk and granular material simulation. EDEM uses discrete element method (DEM) to simulate and analyze the behavior of coal, mined ores, soils, fibers, grains, tablets, and powders. 

EDEM simulation provides engineers with insight into how those materials interact with equipment during a range of operation and process conditions. It can be used by itself or combined with other CAE tools.

Companies in the heavy equipment, off-road, mining, steelmaking, and process manufacturing industries use EDEM to understand and predict granular material behaviors, evaluate equipment performance, and optimize processes.

## Why deploy EDEM on Azure?

- You can use EDEM to model particle shape by using the multi-sphere method.
- EDEM is highly parallelized for use on multi-core shared memory workstations, GPU hardware, and multi-GPU systems.
- The solver engine is fully double precision across all platforms.
- EDEM can simulate large and complex particle systems.
- EDEM provides advanced post-processing capabilities.

### Components

-   [Azure Virtual
    Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines) is
    used to create Windows VMs. For information about deploying VMs and installing the
        drivers, see [Windows VMs on Azure](../../reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm.yml).
-   [Azure Virtual
    Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) is
    used to create a private network infrastructure in the cloud. 
    -   [Network security
        groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview)
     restrict access to the VMs.  
    -   A public IP address connects the internet to the VMs.   
-   A physical SSD provides storage.

## Compute sizing and drivers

Performance tests of EDEM on Azure used [NCv3](/azure/virtual-machines/ncv3-series), [NC A100 v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nc-a100-v4-series), and [ND A100 v4](/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series) series VMs running on Windows. The following table provides the configuration details.

## Azure cost

Only model running time (wall-clock time) is considered for these cost calculations. Application installation time isn't considered. The calculations are indicative. The actual numbers depend on the size of the model.

You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate costs for your configuration.

The following tables provide elapsed times in hours. To compute the total cost, multiply the elapsed time by the Azure VM hourly cost. For current hourly costs, see [Windows Virtual Machines Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/#pricing).

## Summary

- EDEM 2021.1 was deployed and tested on ND A100 v4 and NCv3 VMs with one GPU and two GPUs. EDEM 2022.1 was deployed and tested on ND A100 v4 and NC A100 v4 VMs with one GPU and multiple GPUs.
- On Azure, the GPU technology in EDEM provides faster processing than CPU configurations. Tests demonstrate speed increases of about 80x with NC A100 v4 A100 GPUs and about 60x with ND A100 v4 A100 GPUs.
- The complexity of the model affects GPU scale-up. 
- The NC A100 v4 VM demonstrates better GPU acceleration than other VM configurations on Azure.
