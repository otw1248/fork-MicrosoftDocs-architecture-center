# Types of harm

This article creates awareness of the different types of harm, so that appropriate mitigation steps can be implemented.

## Risk of injury

### Physical injury

Consider how technology could hurt people or create dangerous environments.

> |Harm|Description|Consideration(s)|Example|
> |-------------|----------|---------|---------|
> |**Overreliance on safety features**|This points out the dependence on technology to make decisions without adequate human oversight.|How might people rely on this technology to keep them safe? How could this technology reduce appropriate human oversight?|A healthcare agent could misdiagnose illness, leading to unnecessary treatment.|
> |**Inadequate fail-safes**|Real-world testing may insufficiently consider a diverse set of users and scenarios.|If this technology fails or is misused, how would people be impacted? At what point could a human intervene? Are there alternative uses that have not been tested for? How would a system failure impact users?|If an automatic door failed to detect a wheelchair during an emergency evacuation, a person could be trapped if there isn't an accessible override button.|
> |**Exposure to unhealthy agents**|Manufacturing, as well as disposal of technology, can jeopardize the health and well-being of workers and nearby inhabitants.|What negative outcomes could come from the manufacturing of your components or devices?|Inadequate safety measures could expose workers to toxins during digital component manufacturing.|

### Emotional or psychological injury

Misused technology can lead to severe emotional and psychological distress.

> |Harm|Description|Consideration(s)|Example|

> |**Overreliance on automation**|Misguided beliefs can lead users to trust the reliability of a digital agent over that of a human.|How could this technology reduce direct interpersonal feedback? How might this technology interface with trusted sources of information? How could sole dependence on an artificial agent impact a person?|A chatbot could be relied upon for relationship advice or mental health counseling instead of a trained professional.|
> |**Distortion of reality or gaslighting**|When intentionally misused, technology can undermine trust and distort someone's sense of reality.|Could this be used to modify digital media or physical environments?|An IoT device could enable monitoring and controlling of an ex-intimate partner from afar.|
> |**Reduced self-esteem/reputation damage**|Some shared content can be harmful, false, misleading, or denigrating.|How could this technology be used to share personal information inappropriately? How could it be manipulated to misuse information and misrepresent people?|Synthetic media "revenge porn" can swap faces, creating the illusion of a person participating in a video who did not.|

## Infringement on human rights

### Dignity loss

Technology can influence how people perceive the world and recognize, engage, and value one another. The exchange of honor and respect between people can be interfered with.

> |Harm|Description|Consideration(s)|Example|
> |-------------|----------|---------|---------|

Conversely, how might unique forms of expression be suppressed? In what ways might the data gathered by this technology be used in feedback to people?|Limited customization options in designing a video game avatar inhibit self-expression of a player's diversity.|
> |**Loss of representation**|Broad categories of generalization obscure, diminish, or erase real identities.|How could this technology constrain identity options?

> |**Skill degradation and complacency**|Overreliance on automation lead to atrophy of manual skills.|In what ways might this technology reduce the accessibility and ability to use manual controls?|Overreliance on automation could lead to an inability to gauge the airplane's true orientation because the pilots have been trained to rely on instruments only.|

## Evaluate harms

Once you've generated a broad list of potential harms, you should complete your Harms Model by evaluating the potential magnitude for each harm category. This will allow you to prioritize your areas of focus. See the following example harms model for reference:

|Contributing factor   |Definition       |
|----------------------|-----------------|
|Severity        |How acutely could the technology impact an individual or group's well-being?        |
|Scale           |How broadly could the impact on well-being be experienced across populations or groups?    |
|Probability     |How likely is the technology to impact individual or group's well-being? |
|Frequency       |How often would an individual or group experience an impact on their well-being from the technology? |

## Next Steps

Use the Harms Model you developed to guide your product development work:

- Seek more information from stakeholders that you identified as potentially experiencing harm.
- Develop and validate the hypothesis for addressing the areas you identified as having the highest potential for harm.
- Integrate the insights into your decisions throughout the technology development process: data collection and model training, system architecture, user experience design, product documentation, feedback loops, and communication capabilities and limitations of the technology.
