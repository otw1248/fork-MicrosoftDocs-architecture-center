# Serverless Functions reference architectures

A reference architecture is a template of required components and the technical requirements to implement them. A reference architecture isn't custom-built for a customer solution, but is a high-level scenario based on extensive experience. Before designing a serverless solution, use a reference architecture to visualize an ideal technical architecture, then blend and integrate it into your environment.

## Common serverless architecture patterns

Common serverless architecture patterns include:

- Serverless APIs, mobile backends, and web backends.
- Event and stream processing, Internet of Things (IoT) data processing, big data, and machine learning pipelines.
- Integration and enterprise service bus to connect line-of-business systems, publish and subscribe (Pub/Sub) to business events.
- Automation and digital transformation and process automation.
- Middleware, software-as-a-Service (SaaS) like Dynamics, and big data projects.

        Real-time file processing for the healthcare scenario: The solution securely uploads patient records as PDF files. The solution then decomposes the data, by processes it using optical character recognition (OCR) detection, and it adds the data to a database for easy queries.

## Featured serverless reference architectures

The following featured serverless reference architectures walk through specific scenarios. See the linked articles for architectural diagrams and details.

### Serverless microservices

The [serverless microservices reference architecture](/samples/azure-samples/serverless-microservices-reference-architecture/serverless-microservices-reference-architecture/) walks you through designing, developing, and delivering the Rideshare application by Relecloud, a fictitious company. You get hands-on instructions for configuring and deploying all the architectural components, with helpful information about each component.

### Serverless web application and event processing with Azure Functions

This two-part solution describes a hypothetical drone delivery system. Drones send in-flight status to the cloud, which stores these messages for later use. A web application allows users to retrieve the messages to get the latest device status.

- You can download the code for this solution from [GitHub](https://github.com/mspnp/serverless-reference-implementation/tree/v0.1.0).
- The article [Code walkthrough: Serverless application with Azure Functions](../web-apps/serverless/architectures/code.yml) walks you through the code and the design processes.

### Event-based cloud automation

Automating workflows and repetitive tasks on the cloud can dramatically improve a DevOps team's productivity. A serverless model is best suited for event-driven automation scenarios. This [event-based automation reference architecture](../reference-architectures/serverless/cloud-automation.yml) illustrates two cloud automation scenarios: cost center tagging and throttling response.

### Multicloud with Serverless Framework

The [Serverless Framework architecture](../example-scenario/serverless/serverless-multicloud.yml) describes how the Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team partnered with a global retailer to deploy a highly available serverless solution across both Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platforms, using the Serverless Framework.
