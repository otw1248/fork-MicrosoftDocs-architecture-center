# Technical workshops and training

The workshops, classes, and learning materials in this article provide technical training for serverless architectures with Azure Functions. These resources help you and your team or customers understand and implement application modernization and cloud-native apps.

## Technical workshops

The [Microsoft Cloud Workshop (MCW)](https://microsoftcloudworkshop.com/) program provides workshops you can host to foster cloud learning and adoption. Each workshop includes presentation decks, trainer and student guides, and hands-on lab guides. Contribute your own content and feedback to add to a robust database of training guides for deploying advanced Azure workloads on the Microsoft Cloud Platform.

Workshops related to application development workloads include:

- [Serverless APIs in Azure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Serverless-APIs). Set of entry-level exercises, which cover the basics of building and managing serverless APIs in Microsoft Azure - with Azure Functions, Azure API Management, and Azure Application Insights.

## Instructor-led training

[Course AZ-204: Developing solutions for Microsoft Azure](/certifications/courses/az-204t00) teaches developers how to create end-to-end solutions in Microsoft Azure. Students learn how to implement Azure compute solutions, create Azure Functions, implement and manage web apps, develop solutions utilizing Azure Storage, implement authentication and authorization, and secure their solutions by using Azure Key Vault and managed identities. Students also learn to connect to and consume Azure and third-party services, and include event- and message-based models in their solutions. The course also covers monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing Azure solutions.

## Microsoft Learn

Microsoft Learn is a free online platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products. The goal is to improve proficiency with fun, guided, hands-on content that's specific to your role and goals. Learning paths are collections of modules that are organized around specific roles like developer, architect, or system admin, or technologies like Azure Web Apps, Azure Functions, or Azure SQL DB. Learning paths provide understanding of different aspects of the technology or role.

Learning paths about serverless apps and Azure Functions include:

- [Create serverless applications](/training/paths/create-serverless-applications/). Learn how to leverage functions to execute server-side logic and build serverless architectures.
- [Architect message brokering and serverless applications in Azure](/training/paths/architect-messaging-serverless/). Learn how to create reliable messaging for your applications, and how to take advantage of serverless application services in Azure.
- [Search all Functions-related learning paths](/training/browse/?products=azure-functions).

## Hands-on labs and how-to guides

- [Build a serverless web app](/labs/build2018/serverlesswebapp/), from the Build 2018 conference
- [Build a Serverless IoT Solution with Python Azure Functions and SignalR](https://dev.to/azure/building-a-serverless-iot-solution-with-python-azure-functions-and-signalr-4ljp)

## Next steps

- [Execute an application assessment](application-assessment.md)
- [Identify and execute a PoC or Pilot project](poc-pilot.md)
