This article describes how to use Model9 Manager to send mainframe data directly to Azure Blob Storage as part of a mainframe modernization migration.

You can use Model9 Shield together with Azure Blob Storage as an alternative to a virtual tape library (VTL) to back up data in a faster and more cost-effective way.

Model9 Gravity transforms mainframe data that's transferred to Azure Blob Storage into open formats that can be used by other Azure services.

### Workflow

1. The Model9 agent is a z/OS started task that sends mainframe data directly to Azure Blob Storage.
2. The Model9 agent sends the data, which is encrypted, to Azure Blob Storage over TCP/IP.
3. Model9 management server manages Model9 policies, activities, and storage.
4. Model9 Gravity transforms mainframe data in Azure Blob Storage into open formats that can be used by Azure services.

### Components

This solution uses the following components.

#### Model9 cloud data platform components

The main components of Model9 cloud data platform are:

- **Model9 agent**. A Java-based application that runs as a started task on one or more z/OS logical partitions (LPARs). It reads and writes data directly from and to Azure Blob Storage over TCP/IP. The Model9 agent can run on zIIP engines, which dramatically reduces general CPU consumption.

- **Model9 management server**. A web application that runs in a Docker container. It manages the web UI and the communication with z/OS agents. It provides a way for you to define several types of policies for data protection, migration, and data archival.

- **Lifecycle management engine**. A Java-based application that runs on-premises on a z/OS LPAR and deletes expired data both from the object storage and from z/OS.

- **Data management command-line interface (CLI)**. A CLI that runs on z/OS LPAR. You can use it to perform backup, restore, archive, recall, and delete resource-based actions to and from Azure Blog Storage.

- **Gravity**. A Docker-based application that supports the transformation of Model9 managed objects into an open format that gets processed by AI, business intelligence, and machine learning applications. The data can be transformed either to a CSV or JSON file, or directly to Azure Database for SQL.

#### Networking and identity

- [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute) extends your on-premises networks into cloud services that are offered by Microsoft over a private connection from a connectivity provider. With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to cloud components such as Azure services and Microsoft 365.

By using Power BI, you can connect to hundreds of data sources, simplify data preparation, and drive ad hoc analysis. You can produce beautiful reports, then publish them for your organization to consume on the web, and across mobile devices.

#### Monitoring

- [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor) delivers a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from cloud and on-premises environments. It contains the Application Insights, Azure Monitor Logs, and Azure Log Analytics features.

- Model9 supports monitoring the status and results of all activities via the **Activities** page in the Model9 UI. For more information, see [Monitoring Activities](https://docs.model9.io/user-and-administrator-guide/monitoring-activities).

### Alternatives

- Instead of installing the Model9 management server in the cloud on Azure Virtual Network, you can install it on-premises. On a Linux or z/Linux OS, you can also install the management server on z/OS Container Extensions (zCX).

- Model9 data transformation service runs externally to the mainframe in an on-premises environment. This setup saves expensive mainframe resources. You can also deploy on the cloud by using either a server instance or container services.

- ExpressRoute provides a private and efficient connection to Azure from on-premises, but you can also use [site-to-site VPN](/azure/vpn-gateway/tutorial-site-to-site-portal).

## Scenario details

Mainframe data that's stored in physical or virtual tape libraries is critical for customers. As this data grows, its volume can require a significant amount of storage. The data can then become more demanding to maintain on-premises. You can easily migrate this data to Azure storage and use it for AI, business intelligence, machine learning, and analytics applications. Azure storage carries several unique benefits over traditional on-premises storage approaches, and includes data management services, scalability, performance, reliability, and security.

Model9 provides an end-to-end suite of cloud data management solutions for mainframes that solves the migration problem — elegantly, cost effectively, and with no application changes. Based on a unique, proven technology, Model9 solutions migrate mainframe data by using secure and expedited technology to access the Azure cloud.

Model9 solutions are designed to save expensive mainframe CPU resources by using the mainframe zIIP engines and to connect the mainframe data to Azure cloud storage. Cloud applications can use the migrated data in Azure storage services. This article outlines a solution for migrating mainframe data to the cloud. Besides Model9, the solution's core components include Azure storage and database services.

### Potential use cases

Model9 offers a suite of services that are based on the Model9 cloud data platform. These services are suitable for the following use cases:

- Make mainframe data available to Azure data services, AI, machine learning, analytics, and business intelligence tools.

- Protect mainframe data with backup and archive to Azure Blob Storage.

- Have mainframe applications write and read data directly to and from Blob Storage.

- Provide protection for mainframe data against cyberattacks by creating an immutable third copy in Azure.
